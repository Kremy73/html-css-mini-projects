# html-css-mini-projects
Am learning web design going to put any small and practice projects here :)
Current plans for future projects on this repo:
1. A basic but nice looking landing page for a fake product
2. A digital business card
3. A responsive navbar
4. A tribute page to a project that means a lot to me
